                    <p>This story is about Maya, a little girl residing in Gundiyat Gaon of Dehradun. Her dad is a scientist and mom is a teacher. Maya’s village has so many trees, birds, animals and butterflies. And there was a beautiful river very close to her home.Everyday they all wake up with the sound Cuckarokooo. Once they wake up, they go out of their home, break a neem branch and use it as a toothbrush, and get ready to start their daily work. Then Maya leaves for school.Maya has her lunch everyday when the sun reaches right above her head, and comes back home when she sees birds flying back to their nest. One day, Maya gets to know that her dad is getting transferred to a village which is near the Thar desert.So Maya’s dad informs everyone to pack their things in a week to head to the new place.The packing and all is done. As they were about to leave, Maya said, “Give me two minutes”.  And she ran towards the river and takes a sip of water looking at those beautiful mountains and trees and says goodbye to them.After a day-long travel, they all finally reach the village.Life is so different here. There are no trees, no birds , no rivers, no animals and it’s very hot and very little water is available.Maya joined a new school, she made new friends, but deep within she missed her village. She started thinking about trees, sounds of squirrels, and frogs sound when it rained.

                    <p>One day, Maya came from the school. She sat outside her home looking at the sky. That is when she saw so many birds in the sky.She asked her mom – “How come today there are so many birds?”Mom replied that these are migratory birds and they travel from one place to another .“Ohhhh!” said Maya, listening to her Mom curiously.When her dad came from the office, she ran to him and she told him about those migratory birds that she spottedShe started crying that she misses her village so much and requested her dad if they can go back!!Dad also feels bad and says -” Sorry Maya! we cannot go back there.”Next day Maya’s dad went to a nearby city and bought 4 birds in a cage.Maya was so happy and she started playing with the birds, feeding them with grains, and  just sitting next to them all day long.One evening, when she opened the cage, the birds flew away in the east direction. She started crying.She went to her mom and asked- “Why did the birds fly away and where did they go?” Her mom answered that they flew toward the forest!Maya asked “why?”. Mom replied- “Because that’s where they live. There are so many trees there, they get fruits to eat, and it is not hot there.”Maya however didn’t get convinced. That day she went to sleep crying.Maya was in her sleep, when an angel appeared in her dream, she asked, “Maya what do you want dear? “Maya says- “ I want to go back to my village."Angel replies,” I cannot do that. But here is a box which can bring your village here! Maya asks, “what? really?”She opens the box in excitement– It’s filled with seeds!Angel informs Maya that she should provide them with food and water whenever necessary and she will have her village in no-time.Maya then wakes up!</p>

                    <p>Next day, Maya woke up early !Maya was wondering what good these seeds were!Then she suddenly remembered what used to happen in her village. Squirrels used to carry these seeds in their mouths and run! And bury them to keep it safe.But these little teethy animals forget the location which then used to become the tree.Maya ran to the kitchen and got one spoon and started digging the soil. She dug and kept the seed inside and covered it with soil and she sprinkled little water for seeds.After 1 week of waiting, Maya sees small seedlings coming out of the soil. And since that day Maya kept watering the plant as angel had asked her to do.The plant grew day by day. And after 2 months of time Maya saw some small flowers on the plant. Oh man!She was excited.It was a dark red flower. It is something which she has never seen before. </p>

                    <p>A week later there were so many flowers on the plant. She couldn’t believe her eyes. Now she is confused – Am I still dreaming or is it actually happening? She questions herself.That day she went to school very happily. Maya tells all her friends about the flowers. But no-body was ready to believe it, because in that desert nobody has ever grown a plant / tree.Now all her friends want to come and visit her place. And that time, there is even a bigger surprise waiting for Maya.All her friends are walking back to Maya’s home to see those flowers to know whether it’s actually there or not.When they arrived they saw those flowers and everyone screamed out of joy – “Oh my God! what is this, how has this happened?”And suddenly they saw a butterfly coming and sitting on a flower. Out of excitement, they all started jumping up and down.They were screaming, laughing , and congratulating each other in joy. It was unbelievable. Because they never saw a butterfly in that village.Maya started spending more and more time with plants and trees. She sat and talked with them whenever she was free.Maya made sure they were healthy by providing them with good nutritional food and water.</p>

                    <p>A year passes, the trees and plants saw their first summer and winter.One fine day Maya spotted a flower that’s turning into a round object.And that’s when she realized it’s actually a fruit. She got super excited .She never knew its flower that turns into vegetables/fruits.She ran back home and called daddy to come and see those fruits. He was so surprised to see the result.He asked her-”How did you manage to grow such big trees when we don’t have so much water?”Then Maya told her dad that she saved water simply by not wasting it as water is the most precious thing on the planet!She said that just by turning off the tap while brushing, we can save enough to water 2 plants. By being conscious while taking a bath, she could save enough to water 3 plants. Also, she saved the discarded water from her water filter at home in different utensils to water up to 6 plants!Her dad paused Maya and asked -”But how is the tree so healthy? The tree needs nutrition just like us other than water!”Maya said- “Yes, daddy I know!”That’s why I gave the plants all the waste from the kitchen!Mom said, if I give onion peels, orange peels, extra veggies, eggshells to plants, that will add nutrition to the plant.Maya’s dad added further that -”  I am so proud of you Maya! Looking at you, even I am getting inspired! It’s surprising that being a scientist I know a lot but don’t do much for our Earth!”Maya with a smile on her face replied to her dad -” Let’s do this together dad and be Super Heroes!”Dad surprisingly smiles back at Maya -” SuperHeroes!!”Maya goes on- “Yes! The superheroes we know only protect the humans, but I want to protect all the trees, animals, birds , insects.”Dad in an affirmative tone adds to that-” In that way, we will actually protect humans too!”And then, Maya and her dad, just by planting trees, made the village a better place to live. The trees attracted clouds, it started to rain often and that yellow patch of Earth became just like the village she dreamt of where Maya and her family lived happily thereafter!
